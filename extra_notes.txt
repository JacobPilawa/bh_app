Overall notes:
* Joined (star) and (stars) from Remco's paper table
* I think there might have been 2 overlapping points between Remcos CO targets and those in Davis' review
* i obtained the velocity dispersions for the galaxy's in emily's paper from MASSSIVE 1 if available. if not in that source, i tried to find quoted value from the dynamical measurement.




Notes on particular galaxies:

NGC1097: only listed 3 sigma errors
NGC3258: 1 sigma errors added in quadrature
NGC612: three upper limits quoted, i averaged
NGC524: 3 sigma uncertainties
NGC4429: hard to tell what these uncertainties are, but im adding the abstract values in quadrature
NGC 4751: rounded to 1 less digit precision because of my table constraints; can definitely fix this
NGC1684:  rounded to 1 less digit precision because of my table constraints; can definitely fix this
NGC997: rounded to 1 less digit precision because of my table constraints; can definitely fix this
NGC1275: weird distance reported, need to double check; also same with BH mass but taking the values they report at least 
NGC3557: weird distnace reporting; also unclear what the errors are
NGC5193: added all errors in quad.
NGC4786: taking their angular diameter distance but they have d_L as well; added all error in quadrature
NGC4261: grabbed d_L; WISDOM AND JONELLE BOTH DID THIS?;
NGC612: grabbed d_L,
NGC1574: grabbed d_L,
NGC315: added errors in quadrature
NGC6861: quoted 1-3e9
NGC1380: applied "40% uncertainty" as quoted in abstract
UGC2698: added errors in quadrature
